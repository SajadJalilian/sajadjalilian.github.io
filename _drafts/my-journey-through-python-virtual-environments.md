Since I started programming in python I was fine using its standard library tool ‘venv’ for all of my work.

In python ecosystem there is 4 famous  tools for creating virtual environments:
- [Standard library venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [Virtualenv package ](https://virtualenv.pypa.io)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io)
- [Conda envirments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html)
